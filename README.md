# Neural Network Visualizer

## General Process & Overview

<p>Neural Networks were, and still are, a big interest of mine. Ever since I learned TensorFlow, I would go on Kaggle and create Neural Networks to predict outcomes based on data. However, I have noticed that visualizing Neural Networks was also a big part of understanding how they work. For this reason, I set my goals towards making a simple visualizer to show what Neural Network architectures generally look like.</p>

<p>To create this project, I first started by creating a <a href="https://www.manim.community/">Manim</a> script to create the visualization videos. Using a class structure and various methods, I created a Python file that can take a user's input and output a high-quality Neural Network video that the user can then download. The next step would be to create a frontend website to allow the user to input their specifications. To do this, I simply created an HTML page to structure the website, then used css to style the website. Finally, I created a flask script to be able to not only deploy the website, but be able to connect the frontend with the manim script to create and post the Neural Network videos. </p>
